  **Design Movement**: Clean Energy Industrial
  **Core Principles**: Precision, Transparency, Sustainability, Professionalism
  **Color Philosophy**: Deep solar blues and technical greys to convey engineering precision, accented with vibrant energy yellow/green for key metrics. The palette should feel grounded and trustworthy, like financial software but specific to renewable energy.
  **Layout Paradigm**: Dashboard-centric with a persistent sidebar for inputs and a main content area for real-time visualization. Split-screen approach on larger displays to show inputs alongside results.
  **Signature Elements**:
    - Data cards with subtle glassmorphism effects
    - Thin, technical grid lines in backgrounds
    - Interactive charts that respond immediately to input changes
  **Interaction Philosophy**: Immediate feedback loop - as users adjust sliders or inputs, the LCOE and financial metrics update instantly with smooth transitions.
  **Animation**: Smooth number counters for financial metrics, gentle fade-ins for chart elements, and crisp transitions between views.
  **Typography System**:
    - Headings: 'Space Grotesk' or 'Outfit' for a modern, technical feel
    - Body/Data: 'Inter' or 'JetBrains Mono' for tabular data readability and precision

  **Design Movement**: Eco-Futurism
  **Core Principles**: Organic, Fluid, Optimistic, High-Tech
  **Color Philosophy**: A light, airy base with soft gradients of sky blue, sunlight yellow, and leaf green. The goal is to make the financial modeling feel less like a spreadsheet and more like designing a sustainable future.
  **Layout Paradigm**: Card-based flow where users progress through "stages" of the project (Assumptions -> Capex -> Opex -> Results), with a sticky summary bar.
  **Signature Elements**:
    - Rounded corners and soft drop shadows
    - Nature-inspired abstract background patterns
    - Progress indicators that look like charging batteries or filling solar cells
  **Interaction Philosophy**: Guided experience with tooltips and helpers that explain complex financial terms in simple language.
  **Animation**: Fluid, organic motion. Charts "grow" rather than just appearing.
  **Typography System**:
    - Headings: 'DM Sans' for a friendly, approachable geometric look
    - Body: 'Public Sans' for clean, neutral readability

  **Design Movement**: Dark Mode Data Terminal
  **Core Principles**: High Contrast, Focus, Speed, Analyst-Grade
  **Color Philosophy**: Deep charcoal/black background with high-contrast neon accents (cyan, magenta, lime) for data points. Reduces eye strain for heavy users and emphasizes the data above all else.
  **Layout Paradigm**: Dense, information-rich grid layout. Maximizes screen real estate to show as many metrics as possible without scrolling.
  **Signature Elements**:
    - Monospaced fonts for all numbers
    - Stark borders and dividers
    - "Terminal" style input fields
  **Interaction Philosophy**: Power-user focused. Keyboard navigation support, compact inputs, and toggleable detail views.
  **Animation**: Snappy, instant updates. Minimal motion blur. "Blinking cursor" effects.
  **Typography System**:
    - Headings: 'Roboto Mono' or 'Fira Code'
    - Body: 'Roboto Mono' for consistent data alignment
