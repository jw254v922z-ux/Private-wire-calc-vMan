- [x] Test land option metrics calculate correctly (Total Yearly Land Options Income and Land Option Yield)


### Phase 10: Land Rental Terminology Update
- [x] Rename "Land Option Cost" to "Land Rental Cost" in parameters
- [x] Rename "Land Option Income" to "Land Rental Income" in metrics
- [x] Rename "Land Option Yield" to "Land Rental Yield" in metrics
